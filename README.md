# Reactive LiveData [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/musichin/maven/ReactiveLiveData/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/musichin/maven/ReactiveLiveData/_latestVersion) [![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kotlin-1.3.41-blue.svg)](http://kotlinlang.org) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/musichin/reactivelivedata.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/musichin/reactivelivedata)
This library provides basic transformation functions for your [`LiveData`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html) objects

## Functions
* `map`
* `switchMap`
* `switchLatest`
* `filter`
* `filterNotNull`
* `distinct`
* `distinctUntilChanged`
* `merge`
* `combineLatest`
* `startWith`
* `first`
* `take`
* `takeUntil`
* `takeWhile`
* `buffer`
* `cast`
* and more...

## Examples

### `filter`
```kotlin
val source: LiveData<Int> = // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
source.filter { it % 2 == 1 }.observe(this) {
    println(it) // 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
}
```

### `distinct`
```kotlin
val source: LiveData<Int> = // 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5
source.distinct().observe(this) {
    println(it) // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

### `distinctUntilChanged`
```kotlin
val source: LiveData<Int> = // 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5
source.distinctUntilChanged().observe(this) {
    println(it) // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

## Java
Reactive LiveData is fully written in Kotlin but can be also used in pure Java projects.
There are two ways how you can do that. It's recommended to wrap your LiveData in `ReactiveLiveData`:
```java
LiveData<Object> source = // 1, 2, 3, 4
ReactiveLiveData.of(source)
        .cast(Integer.class)
        .map(i -> i * i)
        .observe(this, v -> {
            System.out.println(v);
        });
```

The second possibility is to use functions directly:
```java
LiveData<Object> source = // 1, 2, 3, 4
LiveData<Integer> sourceCasted = ReactiveLiveData.cast(source, Integer.class);
LiveData<Integer> sourceMapped = ReactiveLiveData.map(sourceCasted, i -> i * i);
sourceMapped.observe(this, v -> {
    System.out.println(v);
});
```

## Binaries
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/musichin/maven' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.musichin.reactivelivedata:reactivelivedata:x.y.z'
}
```
